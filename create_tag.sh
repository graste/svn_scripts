usage: $0 --username <SVN_USERNAME> --password <SVN_PASSWORD> <SVN_SOURCE_URL> <SVN_TARGET_URL> <SVN_EXTERNALS_PATH> <COMMIT_MESSAGE>

This script basically does a SVN COPY and pins the externals of the
given relative repository path to their most current revisions. This
Works for relative and absolute externals. The script does not touch
already pinned externals (can't update those).

DOES ONLY SUPPORT RELATIVE EXTERNALS WITH "../" (NOT "^/" ETC. WHAT'S VALID WITH SVN 1.5+ AS WELL)

OPTIONS:

    --username <USER>       SVN username to use for svn info
    --password <PASS>       SVN password for the given user
    <SVN_SOURCE_URL>        SVN URL to use as source for svn copy command
    <SVN_TARGET_URL>        SVN URL to use as target for svn copy command
    <SVN_EXTERNALS_PATH>    path to append to target URL to get directory with externals to pin
    <COMMIT_MESSAGE>        SVN commit message to use for svn copy command

EXAMPLES:

    $0 --username chuck.norris --password r0undhousek1ck https://svn.example.com/ironfist/trunk https://svn.example.com/ironfist/releases/live20100415 /site 'create new tag from trunk and pin all externals of /site folder'
