Some simple tools in form of bash scripts to help with recurring SVN tasks like:

- pin externals of paths in a working copy
- create TAG with pinned externals of a given path
- create RELEASE with pinned externals of a given path

TAGs do pin relative externals, whileas RELEASEs will only pin non-local externals to allow for patching/svnup.
